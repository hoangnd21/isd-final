          Lorem Ipsum<br /> has been the industry's standard <br />dummy text ever <br />since the 1500s,
          when an unknown printer took a<br /> galley of type and scrambled<br /> it to make a type specimen book.
          It <br />has survived no<br />t only five centuries, bu<br />t also the leap into electronic typesetting,
          remaini<br />ng essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 196<br />0s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
          and more recently with <br />desktop publis<br />hing software li<br />ke Ald<br />us Page<br />Maker in<br />cluding ve<br />rsions of Lorem Ipsum
